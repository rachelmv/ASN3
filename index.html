        <h1>Rachel Vachon</h1>
        <h2>Content Creator</h2>

        <p>My name is Rachel. Allow me to introduce myself. I’m a photographer, graphic designer, and writer. Creativity is my lifeblood — it’s what gets me up in the morning.</p>
        <p>Beauty, color, and stories are all around us, and I love uniting them through content creation. Whether I’m capturing a moment through my viewfinder, sharing a community member’s story, or communicating a message visually, I enjoy creating content through a variety of media. Quality content also provides solutions to the problems around us.</p>
        <p>In 2013, I received my B.A. in Journalism/Media Writing from Taylor University. Since then, I’ve made the move from Indiana to North Carolina. My work experience while in North Carolina has included working at the North Carolina School Boards Association, as well as various freelance projects. I’m also embracing my love of design by pursuing my second degree: Advertising & Graphic Design at Wake Tech.</p>
